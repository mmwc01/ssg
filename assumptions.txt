-The definition of prefix of a phone number is very different from what is presented here (see https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Telephone_prefix), 
    and depending on where the number is from, the length of the prefix can vary (even within countries),
    so assumed that the prefix is the numbers required to provide country, region and provider in the response body. 

-Assumed the data.json lookup for the prefix takes precedence

-Assumed data.json region, country and operator are accurate (so should coincide with any phone number library lookups)

-Assumed the inputted number is a valid phone number (hence the frontend and api checks)

-Assumed we aren't saving anything into a db for a simple calculated response app

-I think this app would've sufficed without a backend; the calculations and such could've all been done 
    in the frontend with frontend libraries and it would've been faster.
